// Greedy approach that iterate over the given bills array and add or remove the past bills in order to give a change on the basis of current given bill.

// Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of people in queue/ bills we will deal with. We iterate through each customerâ€™s bills exactly once. The loop runs for N iterations and at each iteration the operations performed are constant time.

// Space Complexity: O(1) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input array. It does not require any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
